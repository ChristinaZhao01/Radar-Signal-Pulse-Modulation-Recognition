# Radar Signal Pulse Modulation Recognition 

## Project contents

- Generated radar signal datasets with signal-to-noise ratios ranging from -10db to 8db in 2db steps using Matlab for 12 modulation formats.

- Converted the signals into time-frequency images utilizing CTFD time-frequency analysis.

- Designed a deep convolutional neural network model with separable convolutions and residual blocks to identify and classify the signal modulation formats.
